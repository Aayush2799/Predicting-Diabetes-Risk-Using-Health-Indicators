Predicting Diabetes Risk Using Machine Learning

Overview

This project applies machine learning to predict an individual’s diabetes risk using health, lifestyle, and demographic factors. By analyzing the UCI Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset, we aimed to classify individuals into three categories: Non-Diabetic, Pre-Diabetic, and Diabetic. The goal is to enable early detection and provide actionable insights to support better healthcare decisions.

Key Details
	•	Objective: Develop a predictive model to assist healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk individuals for early intervention.
	•	Dataset: Over 250,000 entries with 21 features, including BMI, blood pressure, smoking habits, and physical activity.
	•	Exploration: Performed exploratory data analysis to uncover relationships between features and diabetes risk.
	•	Models Used:
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Random Forest
	•	XGBoost (best model with ~83% accuracy)
	•	Feature Importance: Key factors like BMI, General Health, and Age were the most significant predictors of diabetes risk.

Tools & Libraries
	•	Python: For data preprocessing and model implementation.
	•	Pandas & NumPy: For data handling and feature engineering.
	•	Scikit-learn & XGBoost: For machine learning model training and evaluation.
	•	Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Results
	•	Best Model: XGBoost performed the best, achieving ~83% accuracy.
	•	Insights: Identified critical health indicators contributing to diabetes risk, providing valuable information for early detection.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be leveraged to predict chronic health risks and assist in preventative healthcare. Future improvements could focus on addressing class imbalance and enhancing recall for minority classes.
